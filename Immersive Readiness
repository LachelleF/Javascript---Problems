/*Write a function isGoodFreeThrowShooter which takes in a shooting percentage as a number
you can assume will be between 0 and 1; exclusive of 1 and returns based on following criteria
>=0 and < 1
if the number is btw 0 = 0.65, return "Horrible freethrow shooter"
if the number is btw 0.65 - 0.80 return "Decent freethrow shooter"
if the number is btw 0.80 - and 1.00 return "Great freethrow shooter"*/
/*
Each range is inclusive of the lower bound, and exclusive of the upper -- in other words, 
0.65 is counted as a "Decent freethrow shooter" (not "Horrible freethrow shooter") and 0.80 is 
considered a "Great freethrow shooter" (not "Decent freethrow shooter"). Additionally, you can get a number 
as high as 0.99, but never 1 (this is what the original problem statement means by "exclusive of 1").
