/*Write a function isGoodFreeThrowShooter which takes in a shooting percentage as a number

>=0 and < 1

Each range is inclusive of the lower bound, and exclusive of the upper -- in other words, 
0.65 is counted as a "Decent freethrow shooter" (not "Horrible freethrow shooter") and 0.80 is 
considered a "Great freethrow shooter" (not "Decent freethrow shooter"). Additionally, you can get a number 
as high as 0.99, but never 1 (this is what the original problem statement means by "exclusive of 1").
